//
// Self-describing field encoding for read()/write().
//
// The positional format has no room for change: every field is identified purely by
// how many bytes precede it, so adding, removing or reordering one shifts everything
// after it and the reader decodes garbage. Every uiFlag ladder in this codebase exists
// to work around that, one field at a time, by hand.
//
// Here each field carries its own tag and is self-delimiting, so:
//
//   - a field the reader does not know is skipped, not fatal. An older build can read
//     a newer save as long as it only needs the fields it already understands.
//   - a field the writer did not emit keeps whatever reset() gave it. Removing a field
//     costs nothing.
//   - order stops mattering. Fields can be written in any order and regrouped freely.
//
// Wire format, protobuf's, because it is small and proven:
//
//   record  := varint byteLength, then that many bytes of fields
//   field   := varint key, payload
//   key     := (tag << 1) | wiretype
//   payload := wiretype 0 -> one varint (self-delimiting)
//              wiretype 1 -> varint byteLength, then that many bytes
//
// Signed values are zigzagged so small negatives stay one byte. A typical small int
// costs one byte of key plus one of value, against four for a raw int today -- so a
// tagged save is expected to be SMALLER than a positional one, not larger.
//
// The whole record is length-prefixed and buffered in memory: one bulk stream call per
// object instead of a virtual call per byte, and a record that fails to parse can be
// stepped over without taking the rest of the stream with it.
//
// Tag numbers are per class and MUST be append-only. Renumbering an existing tag makes
// every save written before the change decode that field as something else, silently.
// Retiring a field means leaving its tag unused, never reusing the number.

## This map script is designed to simulate a single continental region, such as
## Europe or Africa rather than an entire global world.  The script attempts to
## generate a single primary landmass with a highly detailed coastline and
## features that are interesting and add a believable atmosphere to the game
## world.  Being a regional map, features such as wrapping are only partially
## supported, they work from a functional standpoint however the world isn't
## created with wrapping in mind so there may be anomolies near the world edges.
##
## The climate is also designed to simulate a single region rather than a global
## climate.  This means that while you can have a full range of tropical, arctic
## and temperate zones you will not have two arctic zones.  This is done so the
## climate zones can be larger and more detailed even with the reduced detail
## caused by the coarse resolution of Civ4's tile-based maps.

## Version History
##
## 2.57 -   Fixed an error where the default option for Deserts, Jungles
##             and Taiga were using a High selection instead
##          Added an option for team start player distribution (MST)
##          Added a new selection for the Desert option: Minimal
##          Added two new selections for the Plains option: Low, Reduced
##
## 2.56 -   Fixed an error that could potentially overwite unique features when
##             ancient city ruins were enabled
##          Added support for IMPROVEMENT_CITY_RUINS_ANCIENT from RiFE
##          Added support for FEATURE_REEF and TERRAIN_OCEAN_DEEP from RiFE
##          Fix preventing Kelp from appearing in freshwater lakes
##          Tweaked Kelp rules, pushing it further away from cool water
##          Fixed 'detail map' used in randomizing high altitude areas, this
##             significantly reduces the chance for long, straight mountain ranges
##
## 2.55 -   Adjusted bonus values in starting plot finder so resources that can
##             be used right away are worth more.
##
## 2.54 -   Added multiplayer specific flavor settings for the Doviello and
##             Illians so they don't start so deep in the snow/tundra
##
## 2.53 -   Adjusted starting plot selection to work from a shuffled list to help
##             prevent the civs from clustering in the southeast corner
##
## 2.52 -   Removed previous change allowing coast tiles based on ocean depth,
##             and returned it to only place coast adjacent to land as that was
##             breaking game mechanics.  Will have to wait for somebody to add
##             a deep ocean texture to their mod (hint, hint)
##
## 2.51 -   Added support for Faerie civilization flavor
##          Fixed a minor indexing error in starting code selection

##
## 2.41 -   Added check to prevent starting plots on peaks even in mods where
##             peaks have a commerce, production or food value above zero.
##          Added safety code to eliminate peaks at the starting plot.

# Notes on Civ Preferences:
#
# neighborValue is added to the distance calculation when determining which starting
# plots to kill (prevent others from using).  It does not scale with map size so
# you need to be careful with excessively high (or negative) numbers.  A safe range
# for all maps sizes is -2 to +2, you can get away with a larger range if few civs
# use negative values.
#
# The terrain values should be self explanatory, higher numbers encourage the civ
# to pick a starting plot with the same terrain(s).  The hill, peak, forest and
# jungle vlaues are added to the terrain value per plot.  So a preference for
# grassland AND jungle will stack in most cases since most jungles are on grass.
# These preference values are also used when cleaning up the starting plots, a
# positive value for forests and jungles will prevent them from being cut and
# a positive value for hills will reverse the cut process causing a few hills to
# be removed but preserving the ones closest to the 'city' plot.  Peaks always
# have the same 33% chance of being downgraded to hills regardless of preference.
#
# Civs with needCoastalStart set to True will reject any starting locations not
# on a coast.  This can result in no valid plots being available in which case
# they will select one randomly (it will be usually be bad).
#
# Adding multiplayer versions of civ preferences can be done by copying the code
# used by the Illians and Doviello, using CyGame().isNetworkMultiPlayer() does
# not detect hotseat games.
